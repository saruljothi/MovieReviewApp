<----INFO---->
400 means that it has been found, but parameters are missing.. this is a fine test for checking auth

if user MUST BE AUTHORIZED then expect isFound() redirect 302
if user IS AUTHORIZED then expect either 200 or 400 (depending on parameters)
NO NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN GET, POST OR PUT. Authorized validation takes place before these endpoint are ever hit
not 401 or 302
